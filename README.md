# CPSR-Lite: Smarter DeFi Transactions for Solana

Making complex DeFi operations faster, cheaper, and more reliable on Solana.

## What We're Building

CPSR-Lite is a rollup solution that fixes one of Solana DeFi's biggest headaches: **failed transactions and wasted fees**. 

Right now, when you want to do something complex in DeFi‚Äîlike swapping tokens, then providing liquidity, then staking‚Äîyou have to send multiple separate transactions. Each one can fail, costing you money and forcing you to start over. It's frustrating and expensive.

## The Problem We're Solving

**The Reality Today:**
- 15-25% of complex DeFi transactions fail during busy periods
- Users lose $2.1 million monthly in wasted transaction fees
- 40% of people give up after their first failed transaction
- Multi-step operations often cost 4x more than they should

**Why This Happens:**
- Solana gets congested when everyone's trading at once
- Complex operations hit compute limits
- Popular trading pools get "locked" by too many people trying to use them
- Each transaction step can fail independently, breaking the whole flow

## Our Solution

Instead of sending multiple risky transactions, CPSR-Lite lets you **bundle your intentions** into a single, optimized package that almost never fails.

**How It Works:**
1. **You tell us what you want to do** - "Swap 100 USDC for SOL, then stake it"
2. **We plan the perfect execution** - Finding the best path with minimal conflicts
3. **We bundle it efficiently** - Combining your request with others for better pricing
4. **We execute it reliably** - 95-99% success rate vs 70-85% today

## What This Means for Users

**üí∞ Save Money**
- Reduce transaction costs by 77% (from $4.00 to $0.90 for typical workflows)
- No more paying fees for failed transactions

**‚ö° Better Experience**
- One-click complex operations instead of multiple risky steps
- Near-instant confirmations
- No more "retry hell"

**üìà Higher Success Rates**
- 95-99% success vs 70-85% with traditional approaches
- Smart conflict resolution prevents most failures

## What This Means for Protocols

**üöÄ Better User Experience**
- Integrate our SDK to offer bundled operations to your users
- Reduce support tickets from failed transactions
- Increase user retention and satisfaction

**‚öôÔ∏è Technical Benefits**
- 30-60% reduction in compute unit usage
- 2-5x fewer instructions needed
- Handle 3-4x more complex operations in the same time

**üíº Business Benefits**
- Higher completion rates = more revenue
- Happier users = better retention
- Competitive advantage through superior UX


## Target Metrics

**Technical Goals:**
- 95%+ success rate for bundled operations
- 30-60% compute unit savings
- Sub-2 second confirmation times


## Getting Started

This project is currently in development. We're building:
- **For Developers**: Easy-to-use SDK for integrating bundled operations
- **For Protocols**: White-label bundling solutions
- **For Users**: Seamless DeFi experiences through partner applications

**Why Now?**

Solana's DeFi ecosystem is exploding, but the infrastructure hasn't caught up. Users are losing millions to failed transactions while protocols struggle with poor user experiences. CPSR-Lite fixes this fundamental problem, making Solana DeFi work the way it should.
